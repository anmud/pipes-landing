**Context AI, seeks to create a massive medical data repository for app development. Context AI has even created specialised hardware for data collection.**

We worked with data collected by different sensors (motion, magnetic field, and sound) and created a display panel to present the data in a 3D simulation. This work also employed data cleansing and deep learning.

**Tools:** Haskell, D3JS, Tensorflow, WebGL.
