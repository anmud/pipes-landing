**We have been running a due diligence process on tag management systems.**

The first step was to get the requirements and to make a market analysis. Based on that requirements we made a  Ð° joint decision to use TagCommander as the main Tag Management Solution. The second step was to implement TagCommander and to provide support for the Tamaris marketing team. At the end of the project, we have been running workshops together with TagCommander employees in the head office at Tamaris.
