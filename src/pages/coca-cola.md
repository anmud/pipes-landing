**At the Coca Cola offices in Berlin we have been working on an intranet tracking project.** 

The main challenge was to get all the requirements for secure, safe, non-pii tracking. The main goal was to provide better visibility into the content that gets consumed by employees across all german-speaking offices. Also dashboarding of the most important metrics for the C-Level team was made by us. After several interruptions due to mission authorizations from the works council, the project was successfully finished.
